## Join the copycat wars

I finished my [tutorial on making a cloning lens](https://learn.arbootcamp.com/snapchat-advanced/clone)! The video version clocks in at just under 40 minutes so it is a doozy of a tutorial. But there is a lot of good stuff in there and I walk you through some troubleshooting. Let me know if you make something cool with it.

## Coming soon to theaters

If you've spent more than 2 seconds on Snapchat Spotlight, you've seen videos featuring the [Screen Scanner Pro](https://www.snapchat.com/unlock/?type=SNAPCODE&uuid=9254193def06435bb9731a174ead43ab&metadata=01) lens. But its solo reign is coming to an end. I'm missing out on the big Spotlight bucks because apparently I'm not good at making videos, so instead I'm making the small bucks on Patreon. One of my patrons requested a tutorial for this sort of effect, and luckily I figured out how it's done just the other week. I don't want to be in the business of leaking everyone's secrets, but it is a really handy technique to know and can be used for more than just the screen scanning/time warp effect.

## Super cool lens

["God Rays x Color"](https://www.snapchat.com/unlock/?type=SNAPCODE&uuid=4fd36079c4e04e0db5882c98ece6022f&metadata=01) is a super cool lens I came across recently. The rainbow rays look really nice over a grayscale background. There's a nice [tutorial by Julien](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkDf3reXvd4) if you want to make your own light rays.
