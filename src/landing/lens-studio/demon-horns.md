That's right. Three minutes. Shawn does a great job of walking you through how to create the demon horn effect in just three minutes. Besides being super straightforward to follow, you don't even need to download any other software other than Lens Studio; the small amount of 3D editing is done in a web browser. Definitely check out this tutorial.

## Expanding your horizons

If you are going for the simple demon horn look, you can't beat Shawn's tutorial. But if you want something a little more complex, you'll want to check out Lens Studio's official [Face Morph](https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/templates/face/face-morph/) documentation. What are the advantages to learning about the face morph more in depth? Rather than start with the demon horns visible, using some of the more advanced face morph features would let you have the horns grow or shrink. This could lead to some pretty cool transformations.
