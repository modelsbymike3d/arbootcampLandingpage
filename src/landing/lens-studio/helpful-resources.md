You don't have to reinvent the wheel. While it's great to learn how to do everything yourself, sometimes you have time or knowledge constraints. Here's a list of helpful resources created by the Lens Studio community that can help you quickly create awesome lenses. Snapchat themselves have [created a ton of useful templates](https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/templates/), but here we are focusing on outside resources. Use them, learn from them, and make something awesome!

## The OLC Github repo

If you aren't familiar with Github, it is a code sharing website. Software developers setup a repository (repo for short), add their code, and then others are free to use or contribute to the repo. Some of the Official Lens Creators (OLC) created a repo for sharing some helpful templates and scripts. Here you'll find anything ranging from a ["Which <BLANK> are you?" template](https://github.com/FrozenAtlas/OLC-Repo/tree/master/Projects%20and%20Templates/WhichBLANKareyouTEMPLATE) to a [script that will cause an object to follow you around the room](https://github.com/FrozenAtlas/OLC-Repo/blob/master/Scripts/Object%20Follow.js). You can find the [OLC Github repo here](https://github.com/FrozenAtlas/OLC-Repo).

## Robin Delaporte's projects

Another great place for some starter projects is [Robin Delaporte's Github repo](https://github.com/robin-dela/snapchat-lenses). Here he's shared some interesting projects he's created. Definitely some cool stuff here to check out.

## Physics with Ashley Fletcher

There is no way to natively simulate physics (e.g. a bouncing ball) within Lens Studio, so Ashley Fletcher got Cannon.js, a popular JavaScript physics library, working inside Lens Studio. This template may require a little more technical knowledge to use, but he does provide an example project with the physics in action. You can [find his code and template here](https://github.com/ashleymarkfletcher/lens-studio-physics).

## Minesweeper

If you like making game lenses, then definitely checkout [SheepWizard's Minesweeper lens](https://github.com/SheepWizard/Snap-Lens-Minesweeper). The entire project is available on Github so you can take a look at their scripts and their setup and learn a few things for your own games.

## Reddit

There is a good sized [Lens Studio community on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SnapLenses/). Most of the posts are people sharing their work or looking for specific lenses, but occasionally someone will share a template or some other helpful resource. It's worth stopping by every so often to see what's going on.

## Discord

If Discord is your thing, [there's a Lens Studio Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/CBjs4Pt) you can join. Here you can find templates, tutorials, scripts, and you can ask questions.

## Conclusion

This list is by no means all inclusive of the many great resources out there for Lens Studio, but hopefully it serves as a good starting point. Now get out there, learn, and give back to the community!
